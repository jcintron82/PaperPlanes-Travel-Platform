## Build Process
The building story of Aphria is a long one. You know what I wanted to be when I was little? An Astronaut. Why? Because they got to see and do things nobody else did. As a kid of course I summed this up as just "cool" but as an adult nowI know what it is; it's experiencing something so surreal and outside of yourself that it's something you will never forget. That feeling is what travel ended up being for me. The feeling of novelty in a new place doing new things with new people. Memories I'll never forget. I've been inspired to build this application since I first learned how to code to be quite honest so to have it come to fruition is great! To be continued...
